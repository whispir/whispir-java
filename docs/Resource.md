# Resource

When youâ€™re creating a resource, the following conditions apply:  - Maximum of 10 MB per file being uploaded - Transactions have an enforced timeout - Resources are available in the Whispir platform for a limited time [90 days]. After this time they are automatically cleaned. This is a configurable setting for Whispir Administrators
