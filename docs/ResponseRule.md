# ResponseRule

Response Rules are useful when your Templates require the end-users to select among known responses [for example, Yes/No, Accept/Decline or ranking something from 1 to 5]  Using Response Rules in combination with Templates allows you to automatically categorise any response to these messages into different response groups for reporting purposes
