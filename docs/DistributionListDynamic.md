# DistributionListDynamic

Dynamic Distribution Lists are lists that are updated based on rules to automatically determine and update the members. For this reason - unlike the Static Distribution Lists - we don't need to specify any members because only the rule[s] will determine the members of a Dynamic Distribution List
