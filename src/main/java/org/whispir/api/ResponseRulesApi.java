Each Response Rule can specify as many Response Template Patterns as required.  Each of the Patterns specified will also dynamically create buttons within any Rich Message that is associated with the Response Rule.  This provides an out of the box capability to quickly gather feedback from the field using a Rich User interface, and leveraging SMS as the delivery mechanism.
