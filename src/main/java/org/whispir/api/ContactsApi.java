     * **Note:** There is no global search feature available where one can search on all the workspaces present in the system (under allowed user permission). So, When no workspace is provided, the search is performed on the default workspace of the user.  ### Searching for contacts with Custom Fields  As Whispir supports extension of the default Contact Profile through the use of Custom Fields. There may be cases where users want to search for Contacts that contain these specific fields. As such, the Whispir API supports searching for contacts using these custom fields.  Any custom field can be searched by adding the custom_ prepended to the name.  For example, if the field name is **StaffId**, then the URL would search for:  &#x60;/contacts?custom_StaffId&#x3D;12345&#x60;
