     * List users (asynchronously)
     * Retrieve a list of users in the account. The result will only be limited to users with ACTIVE status. User’s with other status will not be listed in the results.  Once the request is placed, the response will be a list of url’s to each of the users that the API user has access to/or has requested for via the search criteria.  **Note:** The sample request here shows users from the company the existing API user is associated with. You cannot retrieve users list from outside of your company and users with status !&#x3D; ACTIVE.  ## Retrieving workspace users To retrieve the list of users, the request is made to via GET to &#x60;/workspaces/{workspaceId}/users&#x60; endpoint.  By default there will be a limit of 20 users returned in a request.  The user will use the limit and offset query parameters to determine how many users they would like to receive. (default when not provided will be limit&#x3D;20 &amp; offset&#x3D;0)  ### Searching for users Users can be searched for in a given company by passing in valid search criteria. The search criteria usually can be any of the following user elements (field names) and will be sent in as part of the URI as query parameters. *   First Name *   Last Name *   Title *   Job Title *   Country *   Timezone *   Organization Name *   Division *   Business Unit *   Department *   Team Name *   Role *   Additional Team Name *   Additional Role *   Work Email Address 1 *   Work Mobile Phone 1 *   Work Phone Area Code 1 *   Work Phone 1 *   Status * (see note below)  **Note:** While searching for users via status, use the short code ‘A’ for ACTIVE, similarly, &#39;I’ for INACTIVE, rather than the full words ACTIVE, INACTIVE, etc. so, it is &amp;status&#x3D;A not &amp;status&#x3D;ACTIVE.

     * Create a user
     * Create a new user. Ensure that the necessary permissions are provided to the API account to create or modify user accounts.  ### Activating a User after the creation  When created new users are in the PENDING (P) state. To Activate the user, the User must be set to INACTIVE first via a PUT request and then finally set to ACTIVE (A) via another PUT. They cannot be directly set to (A) from (P).  An user when created is assigned the PENDING status. So, to set the user to ACTIVE, one has to follow the “user state machine” rules. Here’s how we do it: 1.  POST /users for user account creation. Capture the Location header value which is the unique link to the User record. This is used in Step 2 2.  GET /users/{userId} for the user object 3.  PUT /users/{userId} with STATUS set to &#39;INACTIVE’ - using the user object retreived in step 2 4.  PUT /users/{userId} with STATUS set to &#39;ACTIVE’ - using the user object retreived in step 2  **Note:** The status text is case sensitive. Lowercase or mixed case text is invalid. Always use uppercase.  Example: active !&#x3D; ACTIVE; inActive !&#x3D; INACTIVE

An user when created is assigned the PENDING status. So, to set the user to ACTIVE, one has to follow the “user state machine” rules. Here’s how we do it: 1.  POST /users for user account creation.
